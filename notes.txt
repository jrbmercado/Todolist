This is a document that I will update to archive some quick notes I had to google during development in ubuntu linux using vim, python, and git.

Vim Notes:
:wq = Write changes to file then quit vim
esc = Change to normal mode
i = Change to insert mode
double tap d = deletes a whole line
e = skip to end of next word
w = skip to beginning of next word
u = undo

Ubuntu Notes:
mkdir folderName = Create a new folder
rm fileName = Delete a file
cd = change directory
ls = list items in working directory
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt = rename file

Python Notes:
python3 fileName.py = Run a python script
python3 -m unittest = Run all unit tests in a directory as long as they have test_ as a prefix to file name

Git notes:
git status = check files within directory for any changes
git add . = stage all modified files to be committed 
git commit -m "sampleMessage" = commit changes to be pushed to working branch with a message
git push = push changes to working branch (code will now be avalible on github)
git pull = update files in working directory to be up to date with master branch
